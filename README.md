INTRODUCTION
--------------------

This module, in the simplest terms, will open a webpage that showcases the user's
favorite movies. The webpage will display an image of each movie, and each image 
will have the fucntionality of displaying the movie's trailer when the image is 
clicked on. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE PREREQUISITES
----------------------

In order to run this progam, one must have Python 2.7 installed on their Windows or
iOS computer. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

In order to use this program, the only installation required are to download the 
program folder 'MovieProject'. Once downloaded, open the file named 
'entertainment_center'. The file can be opened with any compatible translator, 
such as Python (IDLE). 

IMPLEMENTATION	
--------------

After the file 'entertaiment_center' is open on a compatible translator, all that is
necessary to do is select the "run" command (for example, if you are running Python,
on the Python (IDLE) translator, the command can be found under Run>>Run Module). The 
translator will open up the Python Shell, and moments later it will open a web page
with six interactive movie images. These images each have their own Titles and trailers
which are accessible simply by clicking each image. 

In order to edit this program with the specific movie attributes desired, the user can 
edit the code found in the 'entertainment_center' file with the data and methods necessary
to create your own movie showcase on the webpage. An examle of that would be to simply 
choose on of the 'media.Movie' instances and edit the arguments of these instances to display
the movie title, storyline, image, and movie trailer desired to appear on the webpage after 
the edits have been made.
